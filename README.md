# Graduation Project Numerical code
Version management of the CFD code developed for the Graduation Project: Numerical simulation of bubble detachment in alkaline
water electrolysis.

## Staggered Grid approach
A staggered grid is used along with artificial compressibility to resolve the pressure in the Navier-Stokes momentum-equation.
Forward indexing is used for the staggered grid indices.
